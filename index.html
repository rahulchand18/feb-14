        <h2>Forever yours, Baby ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>
            I knew you are going to accept my proposal. Lots of love and lots of
            hugs kisses and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's have a tour of our journey: Back to 2019 December 15 where you and I used to
            be kids: Two Virat Kohli fans meetup or two online bestfriends meetup? I
            would rather consider this as my first ever date. The first girl whom I
            met outside the chat. I was bit of nervous because I was meeting any
            girl with person for the first time in my life and by watching your
            photos and videos you looked taller than me. I couldn't have spoken a
            single word if you were taller than me literally.

        <p>
            Luckily I was an inch taller than you. After that I was full of confidence and I talked you full day. That
            was the day when I felt myself as a happiest man. After the day ended I was bechain for our next meetup,
            which was unplanned. We then planned to meet on December 25, that 10 days felt like 10 months for me. On
            December 24th (one day before the plan) I just went to her place cause I couldn't wait to meet her.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was how our love started sparkling, my heart stared beating for someone for the first time, every
            notification in my phone
            just felt like yours and my heart started beating faster and faster even though the message was not your.
            Since then till now love for you is just increasing
            and increasing. There may be some misunderstandings, miscommunications, between us, but the love for you
            never faded away.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this Valentine's day I just want to say that, I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH my pumpkin, my lollipop, my
            kuchumuchu, my dairy milk
            I can't imagine my life without you baby. Okay Let's play a game, Close your eyes for 3 seconds, 1 ... 2....
            3...
            What did you see?? Darkness right?? Thats my life without you babyyy.
            Hahaha little old right? I know my love for you is also old and it is ageing like a fine wine.
